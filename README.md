Hello, World! Iâ€™m Shreyas Giridharan (@shreyasgiridharan). I am a Research Assistant working at the University of Stuttgart. 
I specialise in modelling large material mass movements numerically. I primarily used Fortran to write a Material Point Method code to model large deformations. 
At the moment, I am learning Python and C++. Eventually, I wish to complete a open-source MPM code with a library of constitutive laws. 
If you find my work of interest, email me at shreyas.giridharan@gmail.com.
Tschau!
